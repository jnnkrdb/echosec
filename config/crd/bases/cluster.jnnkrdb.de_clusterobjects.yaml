                  Each condition has a unique type and reflects the status of a specific aspect of the resource.

                  - "Progressing": the resource is being created or updated
                  - "Degraded": the resource failed to reach or maintain its desired state

                  The status of each condition is one of True, False, or Unknown.

                        A Time represents an instant in time with nanosecond precision.

                        Programs using times should typically store and pass them as values,
                        not pointers. That is, time variables and struct fields should be of
                        type [time.Time], not *time.Time.

                        A Time value can be used by multiple goroutines simultaneously except
                        that the methods [Time.GobDecode], [Time.UnmarshalBinary], [Time.UnmarshalJSON] and
                        [Time.UnmarshalText] are not concurrency-safe.

                        Time instants can be compared using the [Time.Before], [Time.After], and [Time.Equal] methods.
                        The [Time.Sub] method subtracts two instants, producing a [Duration].
                        The [Time.Add] method adds a Time and a Duration, producing a Time.

                        The zero value of type Time is January 1, year 1, 00:00:00.000000000 UTC.
                        As this time is unlikely to come up in practice, the [Time.IsZero] method gives
                        a simple way of detecting a time that has not been initialized explicitly.

                        Each time has an associated [Location]. The methods [Time.Local], [Time.UTC], and Time.In return a
                        Time with a specific Location. Changing the Location of a Time value with
                        these methods does not change the actual instant it represents, only the time
                        zone in which to interpret it.

                        Representations of a Time value saved by the [Time.GobEncode], [Time.MarshalBinary], [Time.AppendBinary],
                        [Time.MarshalJSON], [Time.MarshalText] and [Time.AppendText] methods store the [Time.Location]'s offset,
                        but not the location name. They therefore lose information about Daylight Saving Time.

                        In addition to the required “wall clock” reading, a Time may contain an optional
                        reading of the current process's monotonic clock, to provide additional precision
                        for comparison or subtraction.
                        See the “Monotonic Clocks” section in the package documentation for details.

                        Note that the Go == operator compares not just the time instant but also the
                        Location and the monotonic clock reading. Therefore, Time values should not
                        be used as map or database keys without first guaranteeing that the
                        identical Location has been set for all values, which can be achieved
                        through use of the UTC or Local method, and that the monotonic clock reading
                        has been stripped by setting t = t.Round(0). In general, prefer t.Equal(u)
                        to t == u, since t.Equal uses the most accurate comparison available and
                        correctly handles the case when only one of its arguments has a monotonic
                        clock reading.
